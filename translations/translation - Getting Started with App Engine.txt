# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	-Initialize App Engine.

	-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	-Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
	
## Steps:
1. Activate Cloud Shell.
-You can list the active account name with this command:
	gcloud auth list
-Example output:
	Credentialed accounts:
	- google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
-You can list the project ID with this command:
	gcloud config list project
-Example output:
	[core]
	project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6

2. Initialize App Engine
-Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
-If prompted to confirm the zone, enter the numeric number corresponding to the zone you want.
-Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
-Navigate to the source directory:
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
	
3. Run Hello World application locally
-Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
	sudo apt-get update
-Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system:
	sudo apt-get install virtualenv
-If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
-Then enter the following command:
	virtualenv -p python3 venv
-Activate the virtual environment:
	source venv/bin/activate
-Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:
	pip install  -r requirements.txt
-Run the application. (Please ignore the warning if any):
	python main.py
-In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
-To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
-To verify that the app is not deployed just check if it is running. No browser will be detected if app is not deployed:
	gcloud app browse

4. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine.
-Navigate to the source directory:
	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
-Deploy your Hello World application.
	gcloud app deploy
-If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
-Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
	gcloud app browse
	
5. Disable the application
-Enter this command:
	gcloud app versions stop
-If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
