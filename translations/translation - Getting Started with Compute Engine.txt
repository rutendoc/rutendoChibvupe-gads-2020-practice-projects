# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
## Objectives:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

	-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

	-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

	-Connect between the two instances.
	
## Steps:
1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http
	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --direction-INGRESS --rules=tcp:80 --target-tags=http

2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line.
Choose a zone from the output of this command and use the grep command to filter the results listing the zones associated with us-central1.
	gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
	
Then continue with the rest of the task:
	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
	
	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"
	
3. Connect between VM instances.
Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
-Connect to my-vm-2:
	gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
-ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
	ping -c 4 my-vm-1
-Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
	ssh my-vm-1
-At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
	sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
-Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
-Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add this text and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
	Hi from YOUR_NAME
-Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
-Exit the editor. Confirm that the webserver is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	curl http://localhost/ 
-Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
-To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	exit
-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
	curl http://my-vm-1/
-Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
-Get the External IP address for my-vm-1:
	gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a
-Paste the copied IP addressof my-vm-1 into the address bar of a new browser tab. 
-Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
